# Kel, Demon of Names
A dangerous guessing game.

For this project, I wanted to make a game based on strange fantasy words. I had to learn a lot about how to manipulate strings. The most difficult parts of the project were creating a deterministic system that worked as an AI opponent and creating a function to score input the way I wanted. There are still a few bugs to work out, but I'm happy with the result.
